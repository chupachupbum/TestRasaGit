        Margin Trading is when investors buy stocks using a credit limit
        provided by the securities company. Investors mortgage their stocks,
        borrow money from securities companies to buy more shares, and pay
        interest and debts to the securities company when selling securities.

        Margin trading interest is set for each securities company and may

        higher than the bank loan interest rate.
  utter_def.trade_margin_ratio:

        Initial margin rate is a percentage of the total value of margin shares
        that investors are  required to pay when buying on a margin account. For
        example, if the investor has 100,000,000 VND,  he or she wants to buy
        VNM with the initial margin of 50%. Then the number of VNM allowed to
        buy  margin is calculated as follows: 100,000,000 VND/50% = 200,000,000
        VND. Thus, investors can buy  200,000,000 VND of VNM when using margin
        service.

        Forward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are
        considered over-the-counter (OTC) instruments.

        agricultural products hedge against a change in the price of an
        underlying asset or commodity.

        Financial institutions that initiate forward contracts are exposed to a

        The net asset value (NAV) represents the net value of an entity and  is

        value of its liabilities. Most commonly used in the context  of a mutual
        fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the NAV represents  the per
        share/unit price of the fund on a specific date or time.
  utter_def.stock_etf_vs_stock:
    - text: >-
        Both ETFs and stocks are traded on stock exchanges, which means they 
        are both widely available. Another similarity is that they are bought 
        and sold at the price they appear to be at the time of purchase. Stocks
        represent shares within individual companies, whereas ETFs offer  shares
        of multiple companies within a packaged bundle. ETFs aren’t bound  to a
        single company, so they can contain stocks in a particular sector  or
        contain stocks that approximate a particular index, like the S&P 500, 
        which contains stocks in multiple sectors. The number of shares per
        stock tends to be stable, although this is not  always the case. Stock
        buybacks, splits, and secondary offerings may  change the number of
        shares per stock, but these don’t happen with  the same regularity as
        they do with an ETF. The number of shares per ETF change so that the
        share price matches  the Net Asset Value (NAV) as closely as possible.
        The NAV measures  the aggregate value of stocks and shares within an ETF
        as compared to the  index that the ETF is intended to approximate.
